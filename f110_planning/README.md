# F1TENTH Planning Algorithms

This repository contains planning and tracking algorithms for the F1TENTH Gym environment. It has been updated to support **Gymnasium** and **Pyglet 2.x**.

## Features

- **Tracking Algorithms**:
  - `PurePursuitPlanner`: Classic geometric path tracking.
  - `LQRPlanner`: Linear Quadratic Regulator based tracking.
  - `StanleyPlanner`: Stanley controller for precise path following.
- **Reactive Algorithms**:
  - `GapFollowerPlanner`: Robust Follow the Gap algorithm (FGM).
  - `DisparityExtenderPlanner`: Disparity extension with obstacle inflation.
  - `BubblePlanner`: Local repulsion from nearest obstacles.
  - `DynamicWaypointPlanner`: Adaptive reactive waypoint generation.
- **Utilities**: Waypoint loading, coordinate transformations, and geometry utilities optimized with `numba`.

## Installation

We recommend installing the package in editable mode inside your virtual environment.

```bash
# Clone the repository (if not already done)
git clone https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_ng.git
cd f1tenth_ng/f110_planning

# Install the package
pip install -e .
```

## Quickstart

### Loading Waypoints

You can use the built-in utility to load waypoints from a CSV file (e.g., a raceline):

```python
from f110_planning.utils import load_waypoints

# Load waypoints (reordered to [x, y, v, th])
waypoints = load_waypoints('data/maps/Example/Example_raceline.csv')
```

### Using a Planner (Pure Pursuit)

Here is a minimal example of using the `PurePursuitPlanner`:

```python
from f110_planning.tracking import PurePursuitPlanner

# Initialize the planner
planner = PurePursuitPlanner(waypoints=waypoints)

# Plan an action based on observation
# obs is the observation dictionary from f110_gym
action = planner.plan(obs)

# action.speed and action.steer are the resulting actuation values
```
